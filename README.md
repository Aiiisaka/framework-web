# Project Ubiquity

## Goal

The purpose of this application is to manage the sales of a car shop through a website.

A user can order one or more products on the website as well as choose a time to pick up the order.

The user can create new specific baskets, however the basket is currently only the main basket. This has not yet been fully programmed.

The user can access the list of his baskets as well as the list of orders already made.
